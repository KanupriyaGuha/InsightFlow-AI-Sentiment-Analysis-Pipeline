## ⚙️ Getting Started

This project demonstrates how modern AI assistants can be deployed as scalable web applications.
To replicate:
1. Connect a large language model backend (e.g., GPT‑4, Claude).
2. Configure workflows for knowledge retrieval and API integrations.
3. Deploy the assistant as a web application.
4. Share the demo link with your users.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Tech Knowledge AI uses a modular architecture combining LLMs, retrieval workflows, and a lightweight web interface.

### Components

- **LLM Backend:** Handles natural language understanding and response generation (e.g., GPT‑4, Claude).

- **Knowledge Retrieval:** Embedding-based search retrieves relevant documents with grounded answers and citations.

- **API & SQL Integrations:** Connects to external systems for dynamic query handling.

- **Web Interface:** Browser-based UI enabling seamless interaction with the assistant.

### Workflow

1. **User Query** → Captured via the web interface.

2. **Intent Recognition** → LLM decides whether to answer directly, query the knowledge base, or call an API.

3. **Retrieval/Integration** → Relevant documents or API results are fetched.

4. **Response Generation** → LLM generates a context-aware answer with source attribution.

5. **Delivery** → Answer is displayed instantly in the web interface.
